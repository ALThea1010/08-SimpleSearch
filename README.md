This program allows you to search for a name in a predefined list. 
Hereâ€™s how it works:

Name List: It starts with a list of names, including "Jake," "Zac," "Ian," "Ron," "Sam," and "Dave." 
User Input: The program prompts you to enter a name you want to search for in that list.

Check for Existence: It then checks if the entered name is in the list. If it finds a match, it retrieves the position of that name and prints it out.

Not Found Case: If the name isn't in the list, the program informs you that the name was not found.
